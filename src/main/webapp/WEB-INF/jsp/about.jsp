Nikki Sperry began her journey into Glass Artistry in 2014 at the University of Wisconsin at River Falls. 
Initially fulfilling a fine art credit, she was quickly enchanted by the infinite complexity and quiet dignity of glasswork. 
This fascination led her to eventually pursue a minor in the art form under the tutelage of Eoin Breadon and to become an active member in the University's glass club. 
She received her degree in Education in 2015 and later continued her glasswork with the non-profit glasswork studio Foci located in the Twin Cities area.

Sperry's work combines personal as well as contemporary design styles.
As she describes it "Art is something you do, not something you are asked to or are forced to do. Art is something that can't be helped. Art is the reflexive activity that isn't biological, it's spiritual." 
Her ability to create functional as well as decorative pieces (sometimes both!) has caught the attention of professors, galleries, and consumers alike. 
When commissioned (or inspired) to create a functional piece some might choose a function over fashion approach. 
Breaking with this mindset, Sperry elects to take the road less traveled with an approach oft-described as functionally fashionable. 
As a prominent abstract glass artist, Sperry specializes in mold work and design. 
Most recently Sperry has focused on community outreach through Foci utilzing her skills as an educator to mentor members of the community in the science and art of glasswork, whilst also pursuing personal projects.

Sperry has mentored glass artists from the beginner to journeyman level. 
She has displayed her work at the University of Wisconsin at River Falls as well as the Foci Gallery and the Minnesota State Fair. 
With a unique background of creative artistry and a passion for teaching, Sperry has fulfilled her dream career as an educator as well as a creator. 
To this day she can't belive she is getting paid for having this much fun. 
And the dream rolls on...
